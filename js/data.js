				"candidateName": 'Sean Barry',
				"candidateTitle": 'Health Communications Manager',
				"statement": ' I grew up in Berkeley and graduated from Berkeley High and Cal. I learned about the city’s challenges as a reporter for the Daily Californian. I’m a problem-solver ready to tackle above-average crime rates, vacant storefronts and skyrocketing rents. My priorities are in tune with the needs of District 7: accountability for sexual assaults; community-based, data-driven policing; increased affordable housing options; and a vibrant and inclusive Telegraph Avenue. With smart planning and a collaborative approach, we can attract new housing and jobs to the campus area while preserving neighborhood character. My service on the Planning Commission, Community Health Commission and Waterfront Commission has taught me how to work effectively to resolve policy differences; twice my commission peers elected me to a leadership position. I’m running for City Council to build bridges between students and neighborhoods while continuing Berkeley’s leadership on climate change, economic justice and public health. Three External Affairs Vice Presidents for the Associated Students of the University of California – Safeena Mecklai, Joey Freeman and Shahryar Abbasi – join state Senator Loni Hancock, Assemblymember Nancy Skinner and a majority of the Berkeley City Council in supporting my candidacy. I’d be honored to earn your vote.',

				"candidateName": 'Kriss Worthington',
				"candidateTitle": 'Berkeley City Councilmember',
				"statement": "I’m endorsed by the Sierra Club, SEIU Local 1021, Berkeley Firefighters 1227, and Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson. Our office has benefitted all residents by involving hundreds of students as interns and Commissioners. These talented diverse Commissioners bring new voices to the table since I appointed the most Asians, Latinos, and Students. Our interns make the office an incubator of innovative ideas. We successfully sponsored the most City Council items including: Campaign Finance Reform; reducing cell-phone theft; technological innovation; Internet Broadcasting of Council meetings; Open Data; Net Neutrality; more Student Housing; opposing Fee-Hikes; lowering Student Loan rates; Sexual Assault and Hate Crime prevention; Economic Development; Rainy Day Fund; Pro Choice; Fossil-Free investments; Community Choice Energy; and helping Veterans, Women, Seniors, LGBT, Homeless, and Disabled communities. We work to include a majority of Dorms,  Greeks, and Co-ops in the student district along with Northside and Southside tenants. We're improving Telegraph by allowing late-night business hours, more housing, pedestrian lighting, and all-ages entertainment. As a strong tenant advocate I'm proud to be endorsed by Rent Board Commissioners Lisa Stephens, Kathy Harr, Dave Blake, Asa Dodsworth: Judy Shelton, Alejandro Soto-Vigil, Jesse Townley, and Pamela Webster."
